Effective inventory management is crucial for businesses aiming to optimize their operations and meet customer demand. However, many companies face common inventory-related challenges, such as stockouts, overstocking, and seasonal fluctuations. These issues not only affect sales and cash flow but also lead to inefficient use of resources. By leveraging advanced analytics tools like Power BI and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), businesses can gain deeper insights into their inventory dynamics. DAX enables organizations to create powerful calculations and forecasts, empowering them to make data-driven decisions that enhance inventory control, improve demand forecasting, and ultimately drive profitability.
